Drucker’s article looks at the metadata used by institutions to describe objects. In the first part of the article, I struggled to identify a clear-cut thesis. Her interest seemed to be in highlighting the importance of metadata and what it provides, which she aids by describing classification systems and standardization across data structures. Metadata is necessary across all fields, as it provides key information about an object’s contents and simplifies the research that a competing institution needs to do. She additionally discusses metadata in the humanities, and the challenges of trying to classify humanistic works by keywords or themes. The issues that certain texts discuss are complicated, such as race and gender, and trying to categorize these themes imparts a bias by the collector, limiting the impact of the text. Throughout the piece, she looks at real examples of classification systems—such as the DDS and LoC—and the differences in local v.s. official knowledge, easily-digestible notes that help the reader understand. Her conclusion didn’t provide much more than a summary, although she addresses “fluid ontologies” as a way to get around differences in knowledge and classification. I appreciated learning about metadata, but would have liked more of an argument.
